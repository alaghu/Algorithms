Algorithms
==========
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/alaghu/Algorithms.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/alaghu/Algorithms)
These are my attempt to learn Algorithms and Ruby. The  and exercises are based on Alogoriths, Fourth Edition
by Robert Sedgewink and Kevin Wayne. Though the book uses Java, I have atgempted a selection of exercises in ruby.On a 
simulair note, I have tried to stick to Test Driven Development by using rspec. 

Thanks
