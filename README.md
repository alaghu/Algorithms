Algorithms
==========
These are my attempt to learn Algorithms and Ruby. The alogoirthms and exercises are based on Alogoriths, Fourth Edition 
by Robert Sedgewink and Kevin Wayne. Though the book uses Java, I have atgempted a selection of exercises in ruby.On a 
simulair note, I have tried to stick to Test Driven Development by using rspec. 

Thanks
