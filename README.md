These are my attempt to learn Algorithms and Ruby. The  and exercises are based on Algorithms, Fourth Edition
by Robert Sedgewink and Kevin Wayne. Though the book uses Java, I have attempted a selection of exercises in ruby.On a similair note, I have tried to stick to Test Driven Development by using rspec.

Thanks
